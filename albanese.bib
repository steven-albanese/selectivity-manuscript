 abstract = {
            Probabilistic programming allows for automatic Bayesian inference on user-defined probabilistic models. Recent advances in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling allow inference on increasingly complex models. This class of MCMC, known as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, requires gradient information which is often not readily available. PyMC3 is a new open source probabilistic programming framework written in Python that uses Theano to compute gradients via automatic differentiation as well as compile probabilistic programs on-the-fly to C for increased speed. Contrary to other probabilistic programming languages, PyMC3 allows model specification directly in Python code. The lack of a domain specific language allows for great flexibility and direct interaction with the model. This paper is a tutorial-style introduction to this software package.

  abstract = {Through sequencing analysis of blood or bone marrow samples from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, we identified BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations in 29 of 32 patients whose disease relapsed after an initial response to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib. Fifteen different amino acid substitutions affecting 13 residues in the kinase domain were found. Mutations fell into two groups-those that alter amino acids that directly contact imatinib and those postulated to prevent BCR-ABL from achieving the inactive conformational state required for imatinib binding. Distinct mutations conferred varying degrees of imatinib resistance. Mutations detected in a subset of patients with stable chronic phase disease correlated with subsequent disease progression. Multiple independent mutant clones were detected in a subset of relapsed cases. Our data support a clonal selection model of preexisting BCR-ABL mutations that confer imatinib resistance.},

  abstract = {Tremendous recent improvements in computer hardware, coupled with advances in sampling techniques and force fields, are now allowing protein\textendash{}ligand binding free energy calculations to be routinely used to aid pharmaceutical drug discovery projects. However, despite these recent innovations, there are still needs for further improvement in sampling algorithms to more adequately sample protein motion relevant to protein\textendash{}ligand binding. Here, we report our work identifying and studying such clear and remaining needs in the apolar cavity of T4 lysozyme L99A. In this study, we model recent experimental results that show the progressive opening of the binding pocket in response to a series of homologous ligands.1 Even while using enhanced sampling techniques, we demonstrate that the predicted relative binding free energies (RBFE) are sensitive to the initial protein conformational state. Particularly, we highlight the importance of sufficient sampling of protein conformational changes and demonstrate how inclusion of three key protein residues in the ``hot'' region of the FEP/REST simulation improves the sampling and resolves this sensitivity, given enough simulation time.},

  volume = {122},
  issn = {0006-4971},
  abstract = {Background Secondary mutations in BCR-ABL are the most common cause of resistance to TKIs in patients (pts) with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Ponatinib is a potent pan-BCR-ABL TKI that has been shown to suppress the emergence of any single mutation in vitro, including T315I, at clinically achievable concentrations (40 nM), though higher concentrations were required to suppress emergence of certain compound mutations (2 mutations in the same BCR-ABL allele). Ponatinib has demonstrated significant clinical activity in pts in the phase 2 PACE trial, 60\% of whom received 3 or more prior TKIs. Responses were observed for each of the 15 mutations present in \&gt;1 chronic phase CML pt at baseline, and no single mutation conferring resistance to ponatinib has emerged to date, though in some cases development of compound mutations has been observed. To gain a more precise understanding of the effects of specific mutations on the clinical efficacy of ponatinib, IC50s for ponatinib, and all other approved TKIs, against 31 single or compound BCR-ABL mutants were determined. To explore the relationship between in vitro potency and clinical efficacy, IC50s were related to ``effective'' TKI levels achieved in patients.Methods TKI potency was assessed in engineered Ba/F3 cells by measuring cell viability at 72 hours. The effective plasma concentration for each TKI was calculated from published average steady-state concentration values for the recommended dose, and adjusted for the functional effects of protein binding. These effects were assessed by determining the degree to which TKI potency was reduced by the presence of physiological concentrations of human serum albumin (HSA) and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG).Results The activity of ponatinib, and 5 other TKIs, against 21 single BCR-ABL mutants is shown in Figure A. Ponatinib potently inhibited viability of native BCR-ABL and all mutants, including T315I (IC50s (nM): 3-16). The IC50s for the other TKIs, excluding T315I (\&gt;4000 for all) ranged from: 201-10,000 (imatinib), 12-784 (nilotinib), 2-104 (dasatinib), 40-1,280 (bosutinib) and 18-5,216 (radotinib). IC50 values were compared to the effective plasma concentration for each TKI (Figure A). Mutants that have previously been associated with clinical resistance to a particular TKI tended to have IC50s that approached or substantially exceeded the effective concentration for that TKI, including most mutants for imatinib, E255K/V, Y253H, L248R, T315I for nilotinib, and V299L, F317C/I/V, T315A/I for dasatinib. The most problematic mutants for bosutinib predicted by this analysis were F317V, L248R, V299L, and T315I. Notably, all mutant IC50s fell below the effective concentration for ponatinib. The activity of all TKIs against 10 clinically-observed BCR-ABL compound mutants was also assessed. Four compound mutants had IC50s near or above the effective concentration for ponatinib (T315I+M351T, E255V+F317I, T315I+E255K, T315I+E255V) (Figure B). All 4, plus others, are also predicted to be problematic for the other TKIs.Conclusions Relating in vitro TKI potency to ``effective'' steady-state plasma concentrations in patients identified mutations known to confer clinical resistance to imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib. This method of analysis suggests that ponatinib may be able to inhibit all single BCR-ABL mutants, but not all compound mutants, a prediction that is thus far consistent with results observed in patients. Compound mutations that are predicted to confer resistance to ponatinib are also predicted to confer resistance to all other approved TKIs. Early introduction of ponatinib may prevent the emergence of single mutations, and thus the sequential development of compound mutations.Disclosures: Gozgit: ARIAD: Employment, Equity Ownership.

  abstract = {PurposeWith prospective clinical sequencing of tumors emerging as a mainstay in cancer care, an urgent need exists for a clinical support tool that distills the clinical implications associated with specific mutation events into a standardized and easily interpretable format. To this end, we developed OncoKB, an expert-guided precision oncology knowledge base.MethodsOncoKB annotates the biologic and oncogenic effects and prognostic and predictive significance of somatic molecular alterations. Potential treatment implications are stratified by the level of evidence that a specific molecular alteration is predictive of drug response on the basis of US Food and Drug Administration labeling, National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, disease-focused expert group recommendations, and scientific literature.ResultsTo date, $>$ 3,000 unique mutations, fusions, and copy number alterations in 418 cancer-associated genes have been annotated. To test the utility of OncoKB, we annotated all genomic events in 5,983 primary tumor samples in 19 cancer types. Forty-one percent of samples harbored at least one potentially actionable alteration, of which 7.5\% were predictive of clinical benefit from a standard treatment. OncoKB annotations are available through a public Web resource (http://oncokb.org) and are incorporated into the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics to facilitate the interpretation of genomic alterations by physicians and researchers.ConclusionOncoKB, a comprehensive and curated precision oncology knowledge base, offers oncologists detailed, evidence-based information about individual somatic mutations and structural alterations present in patient tumors with the goal of supporting optimal treatment decisions.},

Free-energy perturbation (FEP) methods with MCPRO+ were undertaken to calculate the relative binding free energies for several alternate scaffolds. FEP was first applied retrospectively to determine if there is any predictive value; this resulted in 12 of 13 transformations being predicted in a directionally correct manner. FEP was then applied in a prospective manner to evaluate 17 potential targets, resulting in the realization of imidazotriazine 17 (3-(4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenylamino)imidazo[1,2-f][1,2,4]triazin-2-yl)benzamide), which shows a tenfold improvement in activity relative to the parent compound and no increase in atom count.

Here, we use the MM-GBSA approach with the OPLS2005 force field and the VSGB2.0 solvent model to calculate differences in binding free energy between wild type and mutant proteins. Crucially, we made no changes to the scoring model as part of this work on protein-protein binding affinity?the energy model has been developed for structure prediction and has previously been validated only for calculating the energetics of small molecule binding. Here, we compare predictions to experimental data for a set of 418 single residue mutations in 21 targets and find that the MM-GBSA model, on average, performs well at scoring these single protein residue mutations. Correlation between the predicted and experimental change in binding affinity is statistically significant and the model performs well at picking ?hotspots,? or mutations that change binding affinity by more than 1 kcal/mol. The promising performance of this physics-based method with no tuned parameters for predicting binding energies suggests that it can be transferred to other protein engineering problems.},

However, accurately ranking compounds with respect to their estimated binding affinities to a biomolecular target remains highly challenging. We provide an overview of recent work using molecular mechanics energy functions to address this challenge. We briefly review methods that use molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations to predict absolute and relative ligand binding free energies, as well as our own work in which we have developed a physics-based scoring method that can be applied to hundreds of thousands of compounds by invoking a number of simplifying approximations. In our previous studies, we have demonstrated that our scoring method is a promising approach for improving the discrimination between ligands that are known to bind and those that are presumed not to, in virtual screening of large compound databases. In new results presented here, we explore several improvements to our computational method including modifying the dielectric constant used for the protein and ligand interiors, and empirically scaling energy terms to compensate for deficiencies in the energy model. Future directions for further improving our physics-based scoring method are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Janus-activated kinases (JAK) are the mediators of a variety of cytokine signals via their cognate receptors that result in activation of intracellular signaling pathways. Alterations in JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2 signaling contribute to different disease states, and dysregulated JAK\textendash{}STAT signaling is associated with hematologic malignancies, autoimmune disorders, and immune-deficient conditions. Genetic alterations of JAK2 occur in the majority of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms and occur in a subset of patients with acute leukemias. JAK-mediated signaling critically relies on STAT transcription factors, and on activation of the MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling axes. Hyperactive JAK at the apex of these potent oncogenic signaling pathways therefore represents an important target for small-molecule kinase inhibitors in different disease states. The JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib and the JAK3 inhibitor tofacitinib were recently approved for the treatment of myelofibrosis and rheumatoid arthritis, respectively, and additional ATP-competitive JAK inhibitors are in clinical development. Although these agents show clinical activity, the ability of these JAK inhibitors to induce clinical/molecular remissions in hematologic malignancies seems limited and resistance upon chronic drug exposure is seen. Alternative modes of targeting JAK2 such as allosteric kinase inhibition or HSP90 inhibition are under evaluation, as is the use of histone deacetylase inhibitors. Combination therapy approaches integrating inhibition of STAT, PI3K/Akt, and MAPK pathways with JAK kinase inhibitors might be critical to overcome malignancies characterized by dysregulated JAK signaling.

  abstract = {Intrinsic and acquired resistance to HER-targeting drugs occurs in a significant proportion of HER2-overexpressing breast cancers. Thus, there remains a need to identify predictive biomarkers that could improve patient selection and circumvent these types of drug resistance. Here, we report the identification of neuromedin U (NmU) as an extracellular biomarker in cells resistant to HER-targeted drugs. NmU overexpression occurred in cells with acquired or innate resistance to lapatinib, trastuzumab, neratinib, and afatinib, all of which displayed a similar trend upon short-term exposure, suggesting NmU induction may be an early response. An analysis of 3,489 cases of breast cancer showed NmU to be associated with poor patient outcome, particularly those with HER2-overexpressing tumors independent of established prognostic indicators. Ectopic overexpression of NmU in drug-sensitive cells conferred resistance to all HER-targeting drugs, whereas RNAi-mediated attenuation sensitized cells exhibiting acquired or innate drug resistance. Mechanistic investigations suggested that NmU acted through HSP27 as partner protein to stabilize HER2 protein levels. We also obtained evidence of functional NmU receptors on HER2-overexpressing cells, with the addition of exogenous NmU eliciting an elevation in HER2 and EGFR expression along with drug resistance. Finally, we found that NmU seemed to function in cell motility, invasion, and anoikis resistance. In vivo studies revealed that NmU attenuation impaired tumor growth and metastasis. Taken together, our results defined NmU as a candidate drug response biomarker for HER2-overexpressing cancers and as a candidate therapeutic target to limit metastatic progression and improve the efficacy of HER-targeted drugs.

  doi = {10.1073/pnas.1515281112},
  abstract = {Oncogenic ROS1 fusion proteins are molecular drivers in multiple malignancies, including a subset of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The phylogenetic proximity of the ROS1 and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) catalytic domains led to the clinical repurposing of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved ALK inhibitor crizotinib as a ROS1 inhibitor. Despite the antitumor activity of crizotinib observed in both ROS1- and ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients, resistance due to acquisition of ROS1 or ALK kinase domain mutations has been observed clinically, spurring the development of second-generation inhibitors. Here, we profile the sensitivity and selectivity of seven ROS1 and/or ALK inhibitors at various levels of clinical development. In contrast to crizotinib?s dual ROS1/ALK activity, cabozantinib (XL-184) and its structural analog foretinib (XL-880) demonstrate a striking selectivity for ROS1 over ALK. Molecular dynamics simulation studies reveal structural features that distinguish the ROS1 and ALK kinase domains and contribute to differences in binding site and kinase selectivity of the inhibitors tested. Cell-based resistance profiling studies demonstrate that the ROS1-selective inhibitors retain efficacy against the recently reported CD74-ROS1G2032R mutant whereas the dual ROS1/ALK inhibitors are ineffective. Taken together, inhibitor profiling and stringent characterization of the structure?function differences between the ROS1 and ALK kinase domains will facilitate future rational drug design for ROS1- and ALK-driven NSCLC and other malignancies.},

  abstract = {Most patients with BRAFV600-mutant metastatic melanoma develop resistance to selective RAF kinase inhibitors. The spectrum of clinical genetic resistance mechanisms to RAF inhibitors and options for salvage therapy are incompletely understood. We performed whole-exome sequencing on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors from 45 patients with BRAFV600-mutant metastatic melanoma who received vemurafenib or dabrafenib monotherapy. Genetic alterations in known or putative RAF inhibitor resistance genes were observed in 23 of 45 patients (51\%). Besides previously characterized alterations, we discovered a ``long tail'' of new mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway alterations (MAP2K2, MITF) that confer RAF inhibitor resistance. In three cases, multiple resistance gene alterations were observed within the same tumor biopsy. Overall, RAF inhibitor therapy leads to diverse clinical genetic resistance mechanisms, mostly involving MAPK pathway reactivation. Novel therapeutic combinations may be needed to achieve durable clinical control of BRAFV600-mutant melanoma. Integrating clinical genomics with preclinical screens may model subsequent resistance studies. Significance: The use of RAF inhibitors for BRAFV600-mutant metastatic melanoma improves patient outcomes, but most patients demonstrate early or acquired resistance to this targeted therapy. We reveal the genetic landscape of clinical resistance mechanisms to RAF inhibitors from patients using whole-exome sequencing, and experimentally assess new observed mechanisms to define potential subsequent treatment strategies.

  abstract = {Throughout its history, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has set precedents for cancer research and therapy. These range from the identification of the first specific chromosomal abnormality associated with cancer to the development of imatinib as a specific, targeted therapy for the disease. The successful development of imatinib as a therapeutic agent for CML can be attributed directly to decades of scientific discoveries. These discoveries determined that the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase is the critical pathogenetic event in CML and an ideal target for therapy. This was confirmed in clinical trials of imatinib, with imatinib significantly improving the long-term survival of patients with CML. Continuing in this tradition of scientific discoveries leading to improved therapies, the understanding of resistance to imatinib has rapidly led to strategies to circumvent resistance. Continued studies of hematologic malignancies will allow this paradigm of targeting molecular pathogenetic events to be applied to many additional hematologic cancers.},

  doi = {10.1007/s00214-014-1600-8},
  abstract = {Despite considerable advances in computing power, atomistic simulations under nonperiodic boundary conditions, with Coulombic electrostatic interactions and in systems large enough to reduce finite-size associated errors in thermodynamic quantities to within the thermal energy, are still not affordable. As a result, periodic boundary conditions, systems of microscopic size and effective electrostatic interaction functions are frequently resorted to. Ensuing artifacts in thermodynamic quantities are nowadays routinely corrected a posteriori, but the underlying configurational sampling still descends from spurious forces. The present study addresses this problem through the introduction of on-the-fly corrections to the physical forces during an atomistic molecular dynamics simulation. Two different approaches are suggested, where the force corrections are derived from special potential energy terms. In the first approach, the solvent-generated electrostatic potential sampled at a given atom site is restrained to a target value involving corrections for electrostatic artifacts. In the second approach, the long-range regime of the solvent polarization around a given atom site is restrained to the Born polarization, i.e., the solvent polarization corresponding to the ideal situation of a macroscopic system under nonperiodic boundary conditions and governed by Coulombic electrostatic interactions. The restraints are applied to the explicit-water simulation of a hydrated sodium ion, and the effect of the restraints on the structural and energetic properties of the solvent is illustrated. Furthermore, by means of the calculation of the charging free energy of a hydrated sodium ion, it is shown how the electrostatic potential restraint translates into the on-the-fly consideration of the corresponding free-energy correction terms. It is discussed how the restraints can be generalized to situations involving several solute particles. Although the present study considers a very simple system only, it is an important step toward the on-the-fly elimination of finite-size and approximate-electrostatic artifacts during atomistic molecular dynamics simulations.},

	abstract = {Purpose: ABL kinase domain mutations have been implicated in the resistance to the BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib mesylate of Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) leukemia patients. Experimental Design: Using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and sequencing, we screened for ABL kinase domain mutations in 370 Ph+ patients with evidence of hematologic or cytogenetic resistance to imatinib. Results: Mutations were found in 127 of 297 (43\%) evaluable patients. Mutations were found in 27\% of chronic-phase patients (14\% treated with imatinib frontline; 31\% treated with imatinib post-IFN failure), 52\% of accelerated-phase patients, 75\% of myeloid blast crisis patients, and 83\% of lymphoid blast crisis/Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. Mutations were associated in 30\% of patients with primary resistance (44\% hematologic and 28\% cytogenetic) and in 57\% of patients with acquired resistance (23\% patients who lost cytogenetic response; 55\% patients who lost hematologic response; and 87\% patients who progressed to accelerated phase/blast crisis). P-loop and T315I mutations were particularly frequent in advanced-phase chronic myeloid leukemia and Ph+ ALL patients, and often accompanied progression from chronic phase to accelerated phase/blast crisis. Conclusions: We conclude that (a) amino acid substitutions at seven residues (M244V, G250E, Y253F/H, E255K/V, T315I, M351T, and F359V) account for 85\% of all resistance-associated mutations; (b) the search for mutations is important both in case of imatinib failure and in case of loss of response at the hematologic or cytogenetic level; (c) advanced-phase chronic myeloid leukemia and Ph+ ALL patients have a higher likelihood of developing imatinib-resistant mutations; and (d) the presence of either P-loop or T315I mutations in imatinib-treated patients should warn the clinician to reconsider the therapeutic strategy.},

  abstract    = "The identification and design of selective compounds is
                 important for the reduction of unwanted side effects as well
                 as for the development of tool compounds for target validation
                 studies. This is, in particular, true for therapeutically
                 important protein families that possess conserved folds and
                 have numerous members such as kinases. To support the design
                 of selective kinase inhibitors, we developed a novel approach
                 that allows identification of specificity determining
                 subpockets between closely related kinases solely based on
                 their three-dimensional structures. To account for the
                 intrinsic flexibility of the proteins, multiple X-ray
                 structures of the target protein of interest as well as of
                 unwanted off-target(s) are taken into account. The binding
                 pockets of these protein structures are calculated and fused
                 to a combined target and off-target pocket, respectively.
                 Subsequently, shape differences between these two combined
                 pockets are identified via fusion rules. The approach provides
                 a user-friendly visualization of target-specific areas in a
                 binding pocket which should be explored when designing
                 selective compounds. Furthermore, the approach can be easily
                 combined with in silico alanine mutation studies to identify
                 selectivity determining residues. The potential impact of the
                 approach is demonstrated in four retrospective experiments on
                 closely related kinases, i.e., p38$\alpha$ vs Erk2, PAK1 vs
                 PAK4, ITK vs AurA, and BRAF vs VEGFR2. Overall, the presented
                 approach does not require any profiling data for training
                 purposes, provides an intuitive visualization of a large
                 number of protein structures at once, and could also be
                 applied to other target classes.",

  abstract    = "Protein kinases are involved in a variety of diseases
                 including cancer, inflammation, and autoimmune disorders.
                 Although the development of new kinase inhibitors is a major
                 focus in pharmaceutical research, a large number of kinases
                 remained so far unexplored in drug discovery projects. The
                 selection and assessment of targets is an essential but
                 challenging area. Today, a few thousands of experimentally
                 determined kinase structures are available, covering about
                 half of the human kinome. This large structural source allows
                 guiding the target selection via structure-based druggability
                 prediction approaches such as DoGSiteScorer. Here, a thorough
                 analysis of the ATP pockets of the entire human kinome in the
                 DFG-in state is presented in order to prioritize novel kinase
                 structures for drug discovery projects. For this, all human
                 kinase X-ray structures available in the PDB were collected,
                 and homology models were generated for the missing part of the
                 kinome. DoGSiteScorer was used to calculate geometrical and
                 physicochemical properties of the ATP pockets and to predict
                 the potential of each kinase to be druggable. The results
                 indicate that about 75\% of the kinome are in principle
                 druggable. Top ranking structures comprise kinases that are
                 primary targets of known approved drugs but additionally point
                 to so far less explored kinases. The presented analysis
                 provides new insights into the druggability of ATP binding
                 pockets of the entire kinome. We anticipate this comprehensive
                 druggability assessment of protein kinases to be helpful for
                 the community to prioritize so far untapped kinases for drug
                 discovery efforts.",

                 important for the reduction of unwanted side effects as well
                 as for the development of tool compounds for target validation
                 studies. This is, in particular, true for therapeutically
                 important protein families that possess conserved folds and
                 have numerous members such as kinases. To support the design
                 of selective kinase inhibitors, we developed a novel approach
                 that allows identification of specificity determining
                 subpockets between closely related kinases solely based on
                 their three-dimensional structures. To account for the
                 intrinsic flexibility of the proteins, multiple X-ray
                 structures of the target protein of interest as well as of
                 unwanted off-target(s) are taken into account. The binding
                 pockets of these protein structures are calculated and fused
                 to a combined target and off-target pocket, respectively.
                 Subsequently, shape differences between these two combined
                 pockets are identified via fusion rules. The approach provides
                 a user-friendly visualization of target-specific areas in a
                 binding pocket which should be explored when designing
                 selective compounds. Furthermore, the approach can be easily
                 combined with in silico alanine mutation studies to identify
                 selectivity determining residues. The potential impact of the
                 approach is demonstrated in four retrospective experiments on
                 closely related kinases, i.e., p38$\alpha$ vs Erk2, PAK1 vs
                 PAK4, ITK vs AurA, and BRAF vs VEGFR2. Overall, the presented
                 approach does not require any profiling data for training
                 purposes, provides an intuitive visualization of a large
                 number of protein structures at once, and could also be

                 adds considerable complexity to the rational design of new
                 drugs, as it involves the optimization of multiple binding
                 affinities. Computationally, the prediction of binding

                 methodologies are still not available to the computational and

                 profile of three bromodomain inhibitors across multiple

                 case, we also show how the preferred binding orientation of a
                 ligand for different proteins can be estimated via free energy
                 calculations. In the second case, the affinities of a
                 broad-spectrum inhibitor for 22 bromodomains were calculated

                 alterations; no mutations were found in eight

               ff99SB force field improved protein secondary structure balance
               and dynamics from earlier force fields like ff99, but weaknesses
               in side chain rotamer and backbone secondary structure
               preferences have been identified. Here, we performed a complete
               refit of all amino acid side chain dihedral parameters, which
               had been carried over from ff94. The training set of

               to improve transferability of the parameters. Improvement in all
               amino acids was obtained as compared to ff99SB. Parameters were
               also generated for alternate protonation states of ionizable
               side chains. Average errors in relative energies of pairs of
               conformations were under 1.0 kcal/mol as compared to QM, reduced
               35\% from ff99SB. We also took the opportunity to make empirical
               adjustments to the protein backbone dihedral parameters as
               compared to ff99SB. Multiple small adjustments of $\varphi$ and
               $\psi$ parameters were tested against NMR scalar coupling data

               results were obtained from a physically motivated adjustment to
               the $\varphi$ rotational profile that compensates for lack of

                 remained so far unexplored in drug discovery projects. The
                 selection and assessment of targets is an essential but
                 challenging area. Today, a few thousands of experimentally
                 determined kinase structures are available, covering about
                 half of the human kinome. This large structural source allows
                 guiding the target selection via structure-based druggability
                 prediction approaches such as DoGSiteScorer. Here, a thorough
                 analysis of the ATP pockets of the entire human kinome in the
                 DFG-in state is presented in order to prioritize novel kinase
                 structures for drug discovery projects. For this, all human
                 kinase X-ray structures available in the PDB were collected,
                 and homology models were generated for the missing part of the

                 the potential of each kinase to be druggable. The results
                 indicate that about 75\% of the kinome are in principle
                 druggable. Top ranking structures comprise kinases that are
                 primary targets of known approved drugs but additionally point

                 wild-type EGFR. Although this class of mutant-selective EGFR
                 inhibitors is effective clinically in lung cancer patients
                 harboring EGFR(T790M), prior preclinical studies demonstrate
                 that acquired resistance can occur through genomic alterations
                 that activate ERK1/2 signaling. Here, we find that ERK1/2
                 reactivation occurs rapidly following WZ4002 treatment.
                 Concomitant inhibition of ERK1/2 by the MEK inhibitor
                 trametinib prevents ERK1/2 reactivation, enhances

                 hampered by the fact that many reference inhibitors are not

                 trickle of selective inhibitors released in the public domain

                 amounts of available inhibitors has become progressively
                 difficult due to the lack of accurate quantitative descriptors

                 EGFR form, one of the most common mutations in lung cancer

                 electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and Western blot
                 analyses, we examined the order of autophosphorylation in

               inhibitor of several tyrosine kinases, including Abl and c-Kit,
               but displays less potency to inhibit closely homologous tyrosine
               kinases, such as Lck and c-Src. Because many structural features
               of the binding site are highly conserved in these homologous
               kinases, the molecular determinants responsible for the binding
               specificity of Gleevec remain poorly understood. To address this
               issue, free energy perturbation molecular dynamics (FEP/MD)
               simulations with explicit solvent was used to compute the
               binding affinity of Gleevec to Abl, c-Kit, Lck, and c-Src. The
               results of the FEP/MD calculations are in good agreement with
               experiments, enabling a detailed and quantitative dissection of
               the absolute binding free energy in terms of various
               thermodynamic contributions affecting the binding specificity of
               Gleevec to the kinases. Dominant binding free energy
               contributions arises from the van der Waals dispersive
               interaction, compensating about two-thirds of the unfavorable
               free energy penalty associated with the loss of translational,
               rotational, and conformational freedom of the ligand upon
               binding. In contrast, the contributions from electrostatic and
               repulsive interactions nearly cancel out due to solvent effects.
               Furthermore, the calculations show the importance of the
               conformation of the kinase activation loop. Among the kinases
               examined, Abl provides the most favorable binding environment
               for Gleevec via optimal protein--ligand interactions and a small
               free energy cost for loss of the translational, rotational, and
               conformational freedom upon ligand binding. The FEP/MD
               calculations additionally reveal that Lck and c-Src provide
               similar nonbinding interactions with the bound-Gleevec, but the
               former pays less entropic penalty for the ligand losing its
               translational, rotational, and conformational motions to bind,

                 types of cancers. Gleevec, a well-known therapeutic agent
                 against chronic myelogenous leukemia, is an effective
                 inhibitor of Abl tyrosine kinase. However, Gleevec fails to
                 inhibit closely homologous tyrosine kinases, such as c-Src.
                 Because many structural features of the binding site are
                 conserved, the molecular determinants responsible for binding
                 specificity are not immediately apparent. Some have attributed
                 the difference in binding specificity of Gleevec to subtle
                 variations in ligand-protein interactions (binding affinity
                 control), whereas others have proposed that it is the
                 conformation of the DFG motif, in which ligand binding is only
                 accessible to Abl and not to c-Src (conformational selection
                 control). To address this issue, the absolute binding free
                 energy was computed using all-atom molecular dynamics
                 simulations with explicit solvent. The results of the free
                 energy simulations are in good agreement with experiments,
                 thereby enabling a meaningful decomposition of the binding
                 free energy to elucidate the factors controlling Gleevec's
                 binding specificity. The latter is shown to be controlled by a
                 conformational selection mechanism and also by differences in
                 key van der Waals interactions responsible for the
                 stabilization of Gleevec in the binding pocket of Abl.",

               the highly homologous c-Src kinase. Because the ligand binds to
               an inactive form of the protein in which an Asp-Phe-Gly
               structural motif along the activation loop adopts a so-called
               DFG-out conformation, it was suggested that binding specificity
               was controlled by a ``conformational selection'' mechanism. In
               this context, the binding affinity displayed by the kinase
               inhibitor G6G poses an intriguing challenge. Although it
               possesses a chemical core very similar to that of Gleevec, G6G
               is a potent inhibitor of both Abl and c-Src kinases. Both
               inhibitors bind to the DFG-out conformation of the kinases,
               which seems to be in contradiction with the conformational
               selection mechanism. To address this issue and display the
               hidden thermodynamic contributions affecting the binding

               functional group, which is considerably larger than the

               c-Src, these interactions offset the unfavorable free energy
               cost of the DFG-out conformation. When binding to Abl, however,
               G6G experiences an unfavorable free energy penalty due to steric
               clashes with the phosphate-binding loop, yielding an overall
               binding affinity that is similar to that of Gleevec. Such steric
               clashes are absent when G6G binds to c-Src, due to the extended

                 patients harboring non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who
                 initially responded to this therapy. The development of these
                 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is going back to the early
                 90s, where cancer was widely considered and fully treated as a
                 disease of an organ. Fundamental gain of knowledge in cell
                 biology in general and cancer genetics in particular led us to
                 where we currently stand: cancer is a disease that originates
                 in the genome. Fast and affordable gene sequencing paved the
                 way and opened our eyes for the genetic instability of many
                 cancers, particularly EGFR driven NSCLC. This might allow
                 highly rational and personal therapies by aiming at a very
                 particular wild type and mutant kinase pattern. However, the
                 paradigm ``one disease - one target - one drug'' is currently
                 challenged. Both activating and deactivating EGFR mutations
                 are known to render the development of novel targeted drugs
                 difficult. Among all lung adenocarcinomas, only 20\% are
                 driven by EGFR and only a subpopulation has an activating
                 mutation (e.g. L858R), making them sensitive to first
                 generation EGFR inhibitors. Unfortunately, most of them
                 acquire second deactivating mutations (e.g. T790M) during
                 treatment, leading to a complete loss of response. Are
                 specific inhibitors of the double EGFR mutant L858R/T790M the
                 magic bullet? Much scientific evidence but also high
                 expectations justify this approach. Structural biology of EGFR
                 mutants constitutes the basis for highly rational approaches.
                 Second generation pan EGFR inhibitors inhibiting wild type
                 (WT) and mutant EGFR like Afatinib suffer from dose-limiting
                 adverse effects. Inhibition of WT EGFR is considered to be the
                 culprit. Third generation EGFR inhibitors follow two
                 strategies. Mutant selectivity and improved target residential
                 time. These inhibitors display high mutant selectivity and
                 irreversible binding patterns while sparing WT EGFR activity,
                 hence enhancing tumor selectivity while minimizing adverse
                 effects. Third generation EGFR inhibitors are still undergoing
                 preclinical and clinical evaluation. The most advanced are
                 Rociletinib and AZD9291 which displayed encouraging
                 preliminary clinical phase II data regarding response and
                 adverse effects. In the current review we show both a
                 medicinal chemists' approach toward the design of third
                 generation EGFR inhibitors as well as a detailed overview of
                 the development of EGFR inhibitors over the last decade. High
                 interdisciplinary approaches, such as structural biology and
                 time-resolved tumor genetics pave the way toward the
                 development of drugs that target EGFR mutants. This might lead
                 to highly effective targeted and personalized therapies with
                 enhanced response rates for a minor cohort of patients which
                 have to undergo continuous gene sequencing, hence enabling

  abstract    = "Kinase inhibitors are important cancer therapeutics.
                 Polypharmacology is commonly observed, requiring thorough
                 target deconvolution to understand drug mechanism of action.
                 Using chemical proteomics, we analyzed the target spectrum of
                 243 clinically evaluated kinase drugs. The data revealed
                 previously unknown targets for established drugs, offered a
                 perspective on the ``druggable'' kinome, highlighted
                 (non)kinase off-targets, and suggested potential therapeutic
                 applications. Integration of phosphoproteomic data refined
                 drug-affected pathways, identified response markers, and
                 strengthened rationale for combination treatments. We
                 exemplify translational value by discovering SIK2
                 (salt-inducible kinase 2) inhibitors that modulate cytokine
                 production in primary cells, by identifying drugs against the
                 lung cancer survival marker MELK (maternal embryonic leucine
                 zipper kinase), and by repurposing cabozantinib to treat
                 FLT3-ITD-positive acute myeloid leukemia. This resource,
                 available via the ProteomicsDB database, should facilitate
                 basic, clinical, and drug discovery research and aid clinical
                 decision-making.",

abstract = {The identification of lead molecules using computational modeling often relies on approximate, high-throughput approaches, of limited accuracy. We show here that, with a methodology we recently developed, it is possible to predict the relative binding free energies of structurally diverse ligands of the estrogen receptor-alpha using a rigorous statistical thermodynamics approach. Predictions obtained from the simulations with an explicit solvation model are in good qualitative agreement with experimental data, while simulations with implicit solvent models or rank ordering by empirical scoring functions yield predictions of lower quality. In addition, it is shown that free energy techniques can be used to select the most likely binding mode from a set of possible orientations generated by a docking program. It is suggested that the free energy techniques outlined in this study can be used to rank-order, by potency, structurally diverse compounds identified by virtual screening, de novo design or scaffold hopping programs.},

  abstract = {Through sequencing analysis of blood or bone marrow samples from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, we identified BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations in 29 of 32 patients whose disease relapsed after an initial response to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib. Fifteen different amino acid substitutions affecting 13 residues in the kinase domain were found. Mutations fell into two groups-those that alter amino acids that directly contact imatinib and those postulated to prevent BCR-ABL from achieving the inactive conformational state required for imatinib binding. Distinct mutations conferred varying degrees of imatinib resistance. Mutations detected in a subset of patients with stable chronic phase disease correlated with subsequent disease progression. Multiple independent mutant clones were detected in a subset of relapsed cases. Our data support a clonal selection model of preexisting BCR-ABL mutations that confer imatinib resistance.},

  abstract = {Tremendous recent improvements in computer hardware, coupled with advances in sampling techniques and force fields, are now allowing protein\textendash{}ligand binding free energy calculations to be routinely used to aid pharmaceutical drug discovery projects. However, despite these recent innovations, there are still needs for further improvement in sampling algorithms to more adequately sample protein motion relevant to protein\textendash{}ligand binding. Here, we report our work identifying and studying such clear and remaining needs in the apolar cavity of T4 lysozyme L99A. In this study, we model recent experimental results that show the progressive opening of the binding pocket in response to a series of homologous ligands.1 Even while using enhanced sampling techniques, we demonstrate that the predicted relative binding free energies (RBFE) are sensitive to the initial protein conformational state. Particularly, we highlight the importance of sufficient sampling of protein conformational changes and demonstrate how inclusion of three key protein residues in the ``hot'' region of the FEP/REST simulation improves the sampling and resolves this sensitivity, given enough simulation time.},

  abstract = {Background Secondary mutations in BCR-ABL are the most common cause of resistance to TKIs in patients (pts) with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Ponatinib is a potent pan-BCR-ABL TKI that has been shown to suppress the emergence of any single mutation in vitro, including T315I, at clinically achievable concentrations (40 nM), though higher concentrations were required to suppress emergence of certain compound mutations (2 mutations in the same BCR-ABL allele). Ponatinib has demonstrated significant clinical activity in pts in the phase 2 PACE trial, 60\% of whom received 3 or more prior TKIs. Responses were observed for each of the 15 mutations present in \&gt;1 chronic phase CML pt at baseline, and no single mutation conferring resistance to ponatinib has emerged to date, though in some cases development of compound mutations has been observed. To gain a more precise understanding of the effects of specific mutations on the clinical efficacy of ponatinib, IC50s for ponatinib, and all other approved TKIs, against 31 single or compound BCR-ABL mutants were determined. To explore the relationship between in vitro potency and clinical efficacy, IC50s were related to ``effective'' TKI levels achieved in patients.Methods TKI potency was assessed in engineered Ba/F3 cells by measuring cell viability at 72 hours. The effective plasma concentration for each TKI was calculated from published average steady-state concentration values for the recommended dose, and adjusted for the functional effects of protein binding. These effects were assessed by determining the degree to which TKI potency was reduced by the presence of physiological concentrations of human serum albumin (HSA) and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG).Results The activity of ponatinib, and 5 other TKIs, against 21 single BCR-ABL mutants is shown in Figure A. Ponatinib potently inhibited viability of native BCR-ABL and all mutants, including T315I (IC50s (nM): 3-16). The IC50s for the other TKIs, excluding T315I (\&gt;4000 for all) ranged from: 201-10,000 (imatinib), 12-784 (nilotinib), 2-104 (dasatinib), 40-1,280 (bosutinib) and 18-5,216 (radotinib). IC50 values were compared to the effective plasma concentration for each TKI (Figure A). Mutants that have previously been associated with clinical resistance to a particular TKI tended to have IC50s that approached or substantially exceeded the effective concentration for that TKI, including most mutants for imatinib, E255K/V, Y253H, L248R, T315I for nilotinib, and V299L, F317C/I/V, T315A/I for dasatinib. The most problematic mutants for bosutinib predicted by this analysis were F317V, L248R, V299L, and T315I. Notably, all mutant IC50s fell below the effective concentration for ponatinib. The activity of all TKIs against 10 clinically-observed BCR-ABL compound mutants was also assessed. Four compound mutants had IC50s near or above the effective concentration for ponatinib (T315I+M351T, E255V+F317I, T315I+E255K, T315I+E255V) (Figure B). All 4, plus others, are also predicted to be problematic for the other TKIs.Conclusions Relating in vitro TKI potency to ``effective'' steady-state plasma concentrations in patients identified mutations known to confer clinical resistance to imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib. This method of analysis suggests that ponatinib may be able to inhibit all single BCR-ABL mutants, but not all compound mutants, a prediction that is thus far consistent with results observed in patients. Compound mutations that are predicted to confer resistance to ponatinib are also predicted to confer resistance to all other approved TKIs. Early introduction of ponatinib may prevent the emergence of single mutations, and thus the sequential development of compound mutations.Disclosures: Gozgit: ARIAD: Employment, Equity Ownership.

  abstract = {PurposeWith prospective clinical sequencing of tumors emerging as a mainstay in cancer care, an urgent need exists for a clinical support tool that distills the clinical implications associated with specific mutation events into a standardized and easily interpretable format. To this end, we developed OncoKB, an expert-guided precision oncology knowledge base.MethodsOncoKB annotates the biologic and oncogenic effects and prognostic and predictive significance of somatic molecular alterations. Potential treatment implications are stratified by the level of evidence that a specific molecular alteration is predictive of drug response on the basis of US Food and Drug Administration labeling, National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, disease-focused expert group recommendations, and scientific literature.ResultsTo date, $>$ 3,000 unique mutations, fusions, and copy number alterations in 418 cancer-associated genes have been annotated. To test the utility of OncoKB, we annotated all genomic events in 5,983 primary tumor samples in 19 cancer types. Forty-one percent of samples harbored at least one potentially actionable alteration, of which 7.5\% were predictive of clinical benefit from a standard treatment. OncoKB annotations are available through a public Web resource (http://oncokb.org) and are incorporated into the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics to facilitate the interpretation of genomic alterations by physicians and researchers.ConclusionOncoKB, a comprehensive and curated precision oncology knowledge base, offers oncologists detailed, evidence-based information about individual somatic mutations and structural alterations present in patient tumors with the goal of supporting optimal treatment decisions.},

Free-energy perturbation (FEP) methods with MCPRO+ were undertaken to calculate the relative binding free energies for several alternate scaffolds. FEP was first applied retrospectively to determine if there is any predictive value; this resulted in 12 of 13 transformations being predicted in a directionally correct manner. FEP was then applied in a prospective manner to evaluate 17 potential targets, resulting in the realization of imidazotriazine 17 (3-(4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenylamino)imidazo[1,2-f][1,2,4]triazin-2-yl)benzamide), which shows a tenfold improvement in activity relative to the parent compound and no increase in atom count.

Crucially, we made no changes to the scoring model as part of this work on protein-protein binding affinity?the energy model has been developed for structure prediction and has previously been validated only for calculating the energetics of small molecule binding. Here, we compare predictions to experimental data for a set of 418 single residue mutations in 21 targets and find that the MM-GBSA model, on average, performs well at scoring these single protein residue mutations. Correlation between the predicted and experimental change in binding affinity is statistically significant and the model performs well at picking ?hotspots,? or mutations that change binding affinity by more than 1 kcal/mol. The promising performance of this physics-based method with no tuned parameters for predicting binding energies suggests that it can be transferred to other protein engineering problems.},

However, accurately ranking compounds with respect to their estimated binding affinities to a biomolecular target remains highly challenging. We provide an overview of recent work using molecular mechanics energy functions to address this challenge. We briefly review methods that use molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations to predict absolute and relative ligand binding free energies, as well as our own work in which we have developed a physics-based scoring method that can be applied to hundreds of thousands of compounds by invoking a number of simplifying approximations. In our previous studies, we have demonstrated that our scoring method is a promising approach for improving the discrimination between ligands that are known to bind and those that are presumed not to, in virtual screening of large compound databases. In new results presented here, we explore several improvements to our computational method including modifying the dielectric constant used for the protein and ligand interiors, and empirically scaling energy terms to compensate for deficiencies in the energy model. Future directions for further improving our physics-based scoring method are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Janus-activated kinases (JAK) are the mediators of a variety of cytokine signals via their cognate receptors that result in activation of intracellular signaling pathways. Alterations in JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2 signaling contribute to different disease states, and dysregulated JAK\textendash{}STAT signaling is associated with hematologic malignancies, autoimmune disorders, and immune-deficient conditions. Genetic alterations of JAK2 occur in the majority of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms and occur in a subset of patients with acute leukemias. JAK-mediated signaling critically relies on STAT transcription factors, and on activation of the MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling axes. Hyperactive JAK at the apex of these potent oncogenic signaling pathways therefore represents an important target for small-molecule kinase inhibitors in different disease states. The JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib and the JAK3 inhibitor tofacitinib were recently approved for the treatment of myelofibrosis and rheumatoid arthritis, respectively, and additional ATP-competitive JAK inhibitors are in clinical development. Although these agents show clinical activity, the ability of these JAK inhibitors to induce clinical/molecular remissions in hematologic malignancies seems limited and resistance upon chronic drug exposure is seen. Alternative modes of targeting JAK2 such as allosteric kinase inhibition or HSP90 inhibition are under evaluation, as is the use of histone deacetylase inhibitors. Combination therapy approaches integrating inhibition of STAT, PI3K/Akt, and MAPK pathways with JAK kinase inhibitors might be critical to overcome malignancies characterized by dysregulated JAK signaling.

  abstract = {Intrinsic and acquired resistance to HER-targeting drugs occurs in a significant proportion of HER2-overexpressing breast cancers. Thus, there remains a need to identify predictive biomarkers that could improve patient selection and circumvent these types of drug resistance. Here, we report the identification of neuromedin U (NmU) as an extracellular biomarker in cells resistant to HER-targeted drugs. NmU overexpression occurred in cells with acquired or innate resistance to lapatinib, trastuzumab, neratinib, and afatinib, all of which displayed a similar trend upon short-term exposure, suggesting NmU induction may be an early response. An analysis of 3,489 cases of breast cancer showed NmU to be associated with poor patient outcome, particularly those with HER2-overexpressing tumors independent of established prognostic indicators. Ectopic overexpression of NmU in drug-sensitive cells conferred resistance to all HER-targeting drugs, whereas RNAi-mediated attenuation sensitized cells exhibiting acquired or innate drug resistance. Mechanistic investigations suggested that NmU acted through HSP27 as partner protein to stabilize HER2 protein levels. We also obtained evidence of functional NmU receptors on HER2-overexpressing cells, with the addition of exogenous NmU eliciting an elevation in HER2 and EGFR expression along with drug resistance. Finally, we found that NmU seemed to function in cell motility, invasion, and anoikis resistance. In vivo studies revealed that NmU attenuation impaired tumor growth and metastasis. Taken together, our results defined NmU as a candidate drug response biomarker for HER2-overexpressing cancers and as a candidate therapeutic target to limit metastatic progression and improve the efficacy of HER-targeted drugs.

  abstract = {Oncogenic ROS1 fusion proteins are molecular drivers in multiple malignancies, including a subset of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The phylogenetic proximity of the ROS1 and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) catalytic domains led to the clinical repurposing of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved ALK inhibitor crizotinib as a ROS1 inhibitor. Despite the antitumor activity of crizotinib observed in both ROS1- and ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients, resistance due to acquisition of ROS1 or ALK kinase domain mutations has been observed clinically, spurring the development of second-generation inhibitors. Here, we profile the sensitivity and selectivity of seven ROS1 and/or ALK inhibitors at various levels of clinical development. In contrast to crizotinib?s dual ROS1/ALK activity, cabozantinib (XL-184) and its structural analog foretinib (XL-880) demonstrate a striking selectivity for ROS1 over ALK. Molecular dynamics simulation studies reveal structural features that distinguish the ROS1 and ALK kinase domains and contribute to differences in binding site and kinase selectivity of the inhibitors tested. Cell-based resistance profiling studies demonstrate that the ROS1-selective inhibitors retain efficacy against the recently reported CD74-ROS1G2032R mutant whereas the dual ROS1/ALK inhibitors are ineffective. Taken together, inhibitor profiling and stringent characterization of the structure?function differences between the ROS1 and ALK kinase domains will facilitate future rational drug design for ROS1- and ALK-driven NSCLC and other malignancies.},

  abstract = {Most patients with BRAFV600-mutant metastatic melanoma develop resistance to selective RAF kinase inhibitors. The spectrum of clinical genetic resistance mechanisms to RAF inhibitors and options for salvage therapy are incompletely understood. We performed whole-exome sequencing on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors from 45 patients with BRAFV600-mutant metastatic melanoma who received vemurafenib or dabrafenib monotherapy. Genetic alterations in known or putative RAF inhibitor resistance genes were observed in 23 of 45 patients (51\%). Besides previously characterized alterations, we discovered a ``long tail'' of new mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway alterations (MAP2K2, MITF) that confer RAF inhibitor resistance. In three cases, multiple resistance gene alterations were observed within the same tumor biopsy. Overall, RAF inhibitor therapy leads to diverse clinical genetic resistance mechanisms, mostly involving MAPK pathway reactivation. Novel therapeutic combinations may be needed to achieve durable clinical control of BRAFV600-mutant melanoma. Integrating clinical genomics with preclinical screens may model subsequent resistance studies. Significance: The use of RAF inhibitors for BRAFV600-mutant metastatic melanoma improves patient outcomes, but most patients demonstrate early or acquired resistance to this targeted therapy. We reveal the genetic landscape of clinical resistance mechanisms to RAF inhibitors from patients using whole-exome sequencing, and experimentally assess new observed mechanisms to define potential subsequent treatment strategies.

  abstract = {Throughout its history, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has set precedents for cancer research and therapy. These range from the identification of the first specific chromosomal abnormality associated with cancer to the development of imatinib as a specific, targeted therapy for the disease. The successful development of imatinib as a therapeutic agent for CML can be attributed directly to decades of scientific discoveries. These discoveries determined that the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase is the critical pathogenetic event in CML and an ideal target for therapy. This was confirmed in clinical trials of imatinib, with imatinib significantly improving the long-term survival of patients with CML. Continuing in this tradition of scientific discoveries leading to improved therapies, the understanding of resistance to imatinib has rapidly led to strategies to circumvent resistance. Continued studies of hematologic malignancies will allow this paradigm of targeting molecular pathogenetic events to be applied to many additional hematologic cancers.},

  doi = {10.1007/s00214-014-1600-8},
  abstract = {Despite considerable advances in computing power, atomistic simulations under nonperiodic boundary conditions, with Coulombic electrostatic interactions and in systems large enough to reduce finite-size associated errors in thermodynamic quantities to within the thermal energy, are still not affordable. As a result, periodic boundary conditions, systems of microscopic size and effective electrostatic interaction functions are frequently resorted to. Ensuing artifacts in thermodynamic quantities are nowadays routinely corrected a posteriori, but the underlying configurational sampling still descends from spurious forces. The present study addresses this problem through the introduction of on-the-fly corrections to the physical forces during an atomistic molecular dynamics simulation. Two different approaches are suggested, where the force corrections are derived from special potential energy terms. In the first approach, the solvent-generated electrostatic potential sampled at a given atom site is restrained to a target value involving corrections for electrostatic artifacts. In the second approach, the long-range regime of the solvent polarization around a given atom site is restrained to the Born polarization, i.e., the solvent polarization corresponding to the ideal situation of a macroscopic system under nonperiodic boundary conditions and governed by Coulombic electrostatic interactions. The restraints are applied to the explicit-water simulation of a hydrated sodium ion, and the effect of the restraints on the structural and energetic properties of the solvent is illustrated. Furthermore, by means of the calculation of the charging free energy of a hydrated sodium ion, it is shown how the electrostatic potential restraint translates into the on-the-fly consideration of the corresponding free-energy correction terms. It is discussed how the restraints can be generalized to situations involving several solute particles. Although the present study considers a very simple system only, it is an important step toward the on-the-fly elimination of finite-size and approximate-electrostatic artifacts during atomistic molecular dynamics simulations.},

  abstract = {Through sequencing analysis of blood or bone marrow samples from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, we identified BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations in 29 of 32 patients whose disease relapsed after an initial response to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib. Fifteen different amino acid substitutions affecting 13 residues in the kinase domain were found. Mutations fell into two groups-those that alter amino acids that directly contact imatinib and those postulated to prevent BCR-ABL from achieving the inactive conformational state required for imatinib binding. Distinct mutations conferred varying degrees of imatinib resistance. Mutations detected in a subset of patients with stable chronic phase disease correlated with subsequent disease progression. Multiple independent mutant clones were detected in a subset of relapsed cases. Our data support a clonal selection model of preexisting BCR-ABL mutations that confer imatinib resistance.},

  abstract = {Tremendous recent improvements in computer hardware, coupled with advances in sampling techniques and force fields, are now allowing protein\textendash{}ligand binding free energy calculations to be routinely used to aid pharmaceutical drug discovery projects. However, despite these recent innovations, there are still needs for further improvement in sampling algorithms to more adequately sample protein motion relevant to protein\textendash{}ligand binding. Here, we report our work identifying and studying such clear and remaining needs in the apolar cavity of T4 lysozyme L99A. In this study, we model recent experimental results that show the progressive opening of the binding pocket in response to a series of homologous ligands.1 Even while using enhanced sampling techniques, we demonstrate that the predicted relative binding free energies (RBFE) are sensitive to the initial protein conformational state. Particularly, we highlight the importance of sufficient sampling of protein conformational changes and demonstrate how inclusion of three key protein residues in the ``hot'' region of the FEP/REST simulation improves the sampling and resolves this sensitivity, given enough simulation time.},

  abstract = {Background Secondary mutations in BCR-ABL are the most common cause of resistance to TKIs in patients (pts) with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Ponatinib is a potent pan-BCR-ABL TKI that has been shown to suppress the emergence of any single mutation in vitro, including T315I, at clinically achievable concentrations (40 nM), though higher concentrations were required to suppress emergence of certain compound mutations (2 mutations in the same BCR-ABL allele). Ponatinib has demonstrated significant clinical activity in pts in the phase 2 PACE trial, 60\% of whom received 3 or more prior TKIs. Responses were observed for each of the 15 mutations present in \&gt;1 chronic phase CML pt at baseline, and no single mutation conferring resistance to ponatinib has emerged to date, though in some cases development of compound mutations has been observed. To gain a more precise understanding of the effects of specific mutations on the clinical efficacy of ponatinib, IC50s for ponatinib, and all other approved TKIs, against 31 single or compound BCR-ABL mutants were determined. To explore the relationship between in vitro potency and clinical efficacy, IC50s were related to ``effective'' TKI levels achieved in patients.Methods TKI potency was assessed in engineered Ba/F3 cells by measuring cell viability at 72 hours. The effective plasma concentration for each TKI was calculated from published average steady-state concentration values for the recommended dose, and adjusted for the functional effects of protein binding. These effects were assessed by determining the degree to which TKI potency was reduced by the presence of physiological concentrations of human serum albumin (HSA) and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG).Results The activity of ponatinib, and 5 other TKIs, against 21 single BCR-ABL mutants is shown in Figure A. Ponatinib potently inhibited viability of native BCR-ABL and all mutants, including T315I (IC50s (nM): 3-16). The IC50s for the other TKIs, excluding T315I (\&gt;4000 for all) ranged from: 201-10,000 (imatinib), 12-784 (nilotinib), 2-104 (dasatinib), 40-1,280 (bosutinib) and 18-5,216 (radotinib). IC50 values were compared to the effective plasma concentration for each TKI (Figure A). Mutants that have previously been associated with clinical resistance to a particular TKI tended to have IC50s that approached or substantially exceeded the effective concentration for that TKI, including most mutants for imatinib, E255K/V, Y253H, L248R, T315I for nilotinib, and V299L, F317C/I/V, T315A/I for dasatinib. The most problematic mutants for bosutinib predicted by this analysis were F317V, L248R, V299L, and T315I. Notably, all mutant IC50s fell below the effective concentration for ponatinib. The activity of all TKIs against 10 clinically-observed BCR-ABL compound mutants was also assessed. Four compound mutants had IC50s near or above the effective concentration for ponatinib (T315I+M351T, E255V+F317I, T315I+E255K, T315I+E255V) (Figure B). All 4, plus others, are also predicted to be problematic for the other TKIs.Conclusions Relating in vitro TKI potency to ``effective'' steady-state plasma concentrations in patients identified mutations known to confer clinical resistance to imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib. This method of analysis suggests that ponatinib may be able to inhibit all single BCR-ABL mutants, but not all compound mutants, a prediction that is thus far consistent with results observed in patients. Compound mutations that are predicted to confer resistance to ponatinib are also predicted to confer resistance to all other approved TKIs. Early introduction of ponatinib may prevent the emergence of single mutations, and thus the sequential development of compound mutations.Disclosures: Gozgit: ARIAD: Employment, Equity Ownership.

  abstract = {PurposeWith prospective clinical sequencing of tumors emerging as a mainstay in cancer care, an urgent need exists for a clinical support tool that distills the clinical implications associated with specific mutation events into a standardized and easily interpretable format. To this end, we developed OncoKB, an expert-guided precision oncology knowledge base.MethodsOncoKB annotates the biologic and oncogenic effects and prognostic and predictive significance of somatic molecular alterations. Potential treatment implications are stratified by the level of evidence that a specific molecular alteration is predictive of drug response on the basis of US Food and Drug Administration labeling, National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, disease-focused expert group recommendations, and scientific literature.ResultsTo date, $>$ 3,000 unique mutations, fusions, and copy number alterations in 418 cancer-associated genes have been annotated. To test the utility of OncoKB, we annotated all genomic events in 5,983 primary tumor samples in 19 cancer types. Forty-one percent of samples harbored at least one potentially actionable alteration, of which 7.5\% were predictive of clinical benefit from a standard treatment. OncoKB annotations are available through a public Web resource (http://oncokb.org) and are incorporated into the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics to facilitate the interpretation of genomic alterations by physicians and researchers.ConclusionOncoKB, a comprehensive and curated precision oncology knowledge base, offers oncologists detailed, evidence-based information about individual somatic mutations and structural alterations present in patient tumors with the goal of supporting optimal treatment decisions.},

Free-energy perturbation (FEP) methods with MCPRO+ were undertaken to calculate the relative binding free energies for several alternate scaffolds. FEP was first applied retrospectively to determine if there is any predictive value; this resulted in 12 of 13 transformations being predicted in a directionally correct manner. FEP was then applied in a prospective manner to evaluate 17 potential targets, resulting in the realization of imidazotriazine 17 (3-(4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenylamino)imidazo[1,2-f][1,2,4]triazin-2-yl)benzamide), which shows a tenfold improvement in activity relative to the parent compound and no increase in atom count.

Crucially, we made no changes to the scoring model as part of this work on protein-protein binding affinity?the energy model has been developed for structure prediction and has previously been validated only for calculating the energetics of small molecule binding. Here, we compare predictions to experimental data for a set of 418 single residue mutations in 21 targets and find that the MM-GBSA model, on average, performs well at scoring these single protein residue mutations. Correlation between the predicted and experimental change in binding affinity is statistically significant and the model performs well at picking ?hotspots,? or mutations that change binding affinity by more than 1 kcal/mol. The promising performance of this physics-based method with no tuned parameters for predicting binding energies suggests that it can be transferred to other protein engineering problems.},

However, accurately ranking compounds with respect to their estimated binding affinities to a biomolecular target remains highly challenging. We provide an overview of recent work using molecular mechanics energy functions to address this challenge. We briefly review methods that use molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations to predict absolute and relative ligand binding free energies, as well as our own work in which we have developed a physics-based scoring method that can be applied to hundreds of thousands of compounds by invoking a number of simplifying approximations. In our previous studies, we have demonstrated that our scoring method is a promising approach for improving the discrimination between ligands that are known to bind and those that are presumed not to, in virtual screening of large compound databases. In new results presented here, we explore several improvements to our computational method including modifying the dielectric constant used for the protein and ligand interiors, and empirically scaling energy terms to compensate for deficiencies in the energy model. Future directions for further improving our physics-based scoring method are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Janus-activated kinases (JAK) are the mediators of a variety of cytokine signals via their cognate receptors that result in activation of intracellular signaling pathways. Alterations in JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2 signaling contribute to different disease states, and dysregulated JAK\textendash{}STAT signaling is associated with hematologic malignancies, autoimmune disorders, and immune-deficient conditions. Genetic alterations of JAK2 occur in the majority of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms and occur in a subset of patients with acute leukemias. JAK-mediated signaling critically relies on STAT transcription factors, and on activation of the MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling axes. Hyperactive JAK at the apex of these potent oncogenic signaling pathways therefore represents an important target for small-molecule kinase inhibitors in different disease states. The JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib and the JAK3 inhibitor tofacitinib were recently approved for the treatment of myelofibrosis and rheumatoid arthritis, respectively, and additional ATP-competitive JAK inhibitors are in clinical development. Although these agents show clinical activity, the ability of these JAK inhibitors to induce clinical/molecular remissions in hematologic malignancies seems limited and resistance upon chronic drug exposure is seen. Alternative modes of targeting JAK2 such as allosteric kinase inhibition or HSP90 inhibition are under evaluation, as is the use of histone deacetylase inhibitors. Combination therapy approaches integrating inhibition of STAT, PI3K/Akt, and MAPK pathways with JAK kinase inhibitors might be critical to overcome malignancies characterized by dysregulated JAK signaling.

  abstract = {Intrinsic and acquired resistance to HER-targeting drugs occurs in a significant proportion of HER2-overexpressing breast cancers. Thus, there remains a need to identify predictive biomarkers that could improve patient selection and circumvent these types of drug resistance. Here, we report the identification of neuromedin U (NmU) as an extracellular biomarker in cells resistant to HER-targeted drugs. NmU overexpression occurred in cells with acquired or innate resistance to lapatinib, trastuzumab, neratinib, and afatinib, all of which displayed a similar trend upon short-term exposure, suggesting NmU induction may be an early response. An analysis of 3,489 cases of breast cancer showed NmU to be associated with poor patient outcome, particularly those with HER2-overexpressing tumors independent of established prognostic indicators. Ectopic overexpression of NmU in drug-sensitive cells conferred resistance to all HER-targeting drugs, whereas RNAi-mediated attenuation sensitized cells exhibiting acquired or innate drug resistance. Mechanistic investigations suggested that NmU acted through HSP27 as partner protein to stabilize HER2 protein levels. We also obtained evidence of functional NmU receptors on HER2-overexpressing cells, with the addition of exogenous NmU eliciting an elevation in HER2 and EGFR expression along with drug resistance. Finally, we found that NmU seemed to function in cell motility, invasion, and anoikis resistance. In vivo studies revealed that NmU attenuation impaired tumor growth and metastasis. Taken together, our results defined NmU as a candidate drug response biomarker for HER2-overexpressing cancers and as a candidate therapeutic target to limit metastatic progression and improve the efficacy of HER-targeted drugs.

  abstract = {Oncogenic ROS1 fusion proteins are molecular drivers in multiple malignancies, including a subset of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The phylogenetic proximity of the ROS1 and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) catalytic domains led to the clinical repurposing of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved ALK inhibitor crizotinib as a ROS1 inhibitor. Despite the antitumor activity of crizotinib observed in both ROS1- and ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients, resistance due to acquisition of ROS1 or ALK kinase domain mutations has been observed clinically, spurring the development of second-generation inhibitors. Here, we profile the sensitivity and selectivity of seven ROS1 and/or ALK inhibitors at various levels of clinical development. In contrast to crizotinib?s dual ROS1/ALK activity, cabozantinib (XL-184) and its structural analog foretinib (XL-880) demonstrate a striking selectivity for ROS1 over ALK. Molecular dynamics simulation studies reveal structural features that distinguish the ROS1 and ALK kinase domains and contribute to differences in binding site and kinase selectivity of the inhibitors tested. Cell-based resistance profiling studies demonstrate that the ROS1-selective inhibitors retain efficacy against the recently reported CD74-ROS1G2032R mutant whereas the dual ROS1/ALK inhibitors are ineffective. Taken together, inhibitor profiling and stringent characterization of the structure?function differences between the ROS1 and ALK kinase domains will facilitate future rational drug design for ROS1- and ALK-driven NSCLC and other malignancies.},

  abstract = {Most patients with BRAFV600-mutant metastatic melanoma develop resistance to selective RAF kinase inhibitors. The spectrum of clinical genetic resistance mechanisms to RAF inhibitors and options for salvage therapy are incompletely understood. We performed whole-exome sequencing on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors from 45 patients with BRAFV600-mutant metastatic melanoma who received vemurafenib or dabrafenib monotherapy. Genetic alterations in known or putative RAF inhibitor resistance genes were observed in 23 of 45 patients (51\%). Besides previously characterized alterations, we discovered a ``long tail'' of new mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway alterations (MAP2K2, MITF) that confer RAF inhibitor resistance. In three cases, multiple resistance gene alterations were observed within the same tumor biopsy. Overall, RAF inhibitor therapy leads to diverse clinical genetic resistance mechanisms, mostly involving MAPK pathway reactivation. Novel therapeutic combinations may be needed to achieve durable clinical control of BRAFV600-mutant melanoma. Integrating clinical genomics with preclinical screens may model subsequent resistance studies. Significance: The use of RAF inhibitors for BRAFV600-mutant metastatic melanoma improves patient outcomes, but most patients demonstrate early or acquired resistance to this targeted therapy. We reveal the genetic landscape of clinical resistance mechanisms to RAF inhibitors from patients using whole-exome sequencing, and experimentally assess new observed mechanisms to define potential subsequent treatment strategies.

  abstract = {Throughout its history, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has set precedents for cancer research and therapy. These range from the identification of the first specific chromosomal abnormality associated with cancer to the development of imatinib as a specific, targeted therapy for the disease. The successful development of imatinib as a therapeutic agent for CML can be attributed directly to decades of scientific discoveries. These discoveries determined that the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase is the critical pathogenetic event in CML and an ideal target for therapy. This was confirmed in clinical trials of imatinib, with imatinib significantly improving the long-term survival of patients with CML. Continuing in this tradition of scientific discoveries leading to improved therapies, the understanding of resistance to imatinib has rapidly led to strategies to circumvent resistance. Continued studies of hematologic malignancies will allow this paradigm of targeting molecular pathogenetic events to be applied to many additional hematologic cancers.},

  doi = {10.1007/s00214-014-1600-8},
  abstract = {Despite considerable advances in computing power, atomistic simulations under nonperiodic boundary conditions, with Coulombic electrostatic interactions and in systems large enough to reduce finite-size associated errors in thermodynamic quantities to within the thermal energy, are still not affordable. As a result, periodic boundary conditions, systems of microscopic size and effective electrostatic interaction functions are frequently resorted to. Ensuing artifacts in thermodynamic quantities are nowadays routinely corrected a posteriori, but the underlying configurational sampling still descends from spurious forces. The present study addresses this problem through the introduction of on-the-fly corrections to the physical forces during an atomistic molecular dynamics simulation. Two different approaches are suggested, where the force corrections are derived from special potential energy terms. In the first approach, the solvent-generated electrostatic potential sampled at a given atom site is restrained to a target value involving corrections for electrostatic artifacts. In the second approach, the long-range regime of the solvent polarization around a given atom site is restrained to the Born polarization, i.e., the solvent polarization corresponding to the ideal situation of a macroscopic system under nonperiodic boundary conditions and governed by Coulombic electrostatic interactions. The restraints are applied to the explicit-water simulation of a hydrated sodium ion, and the effect of the restraints on the structural and energetic properties of the solvent is illustrated. Furthermore, by means of the calculation of the charging free energy of a hydrated sodium ion, it is shown how the electrostatic potential restraint translates into the on-the-fly consideration of the corresponding free-energy correction terms. It is discussed how the restraints can be generalized to situations involving several solute particles. Although the present study considers a very simple system only, it is an important step toward the on-the-fly elimination of finite-size and approximate-electrostatic artifacts during atomistic molecular dynamics simulations.},
